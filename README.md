# Topic Modeling of Computer Systems Research Papers

This repository contains the code and data processing pipeline for a research project exploring unsupervised classification and topic modeling in academic computer systems literature.

The project evaluates several feature representations—bag-of-words, tf-idf vectors, and LDA topic distributions—and compares their clustering performance using k-means. The goal was to replicate human-assigned conference sessions through unsupervised methods.

Key components include:
- Preprocessing a corpus of 2,500+ conference papers
- Implementing LDA using Gensim and scikit-learn
- Clustering and evaluation with k-means and cosine similarity
- Visualization and analysis of discovered topic structure
